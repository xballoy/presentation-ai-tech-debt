# Code analysis - Claude Code in action

<v-clicks>

### What Claude does

- 🔍 **Glob**: Finds all files
- 📖 **Read**: Reads package.json, server.js, routes, etc.
- 🧠 **Analyze**: Identifies patterns, dependencies, code smells
- 📝 **Generate**: Structured report with priorities

### Why Plan mode?

- ✅ Read-only (no risk)
- ✅ Ideal for exploration and review
- ✅ No accidental modifications
- ✅ Perfect for learning a new codebase

<!--
**Timing**: 5 minutes (including wait time)

**NARRATION DURING THE DEMO** (what you say while Claude runs):

**If Glob tool appears**:
"Claude uses Glob to find all files - it's mapping the project structure"

**If Read tool appears**:
"It's reading package.json to understand dependencies, then the source files"

**If analysis takes time**:
"Claude is now analyzing code patterns, looking for anti-patterns, checking versions..."

**If > 2 minutes**:
"Normally this takes 1-2 minutes. If it takes longer, we have backup screenshots"

**CONTINGENCY IF PROBLEMS**:

**If Internet down**:
→ Switch to pre-prepared screenshots
→ "I had prepared an execution - here's what it normally looks like"

**If Claude errors**:
→ Use as a teaching moment
→ "Perfect example of why we don't blindly trust - even tools have limits"

**If total time > 40 min**:
→ Skip this slide, go directly to results

- "Plan mode only uses read-only tools"
- "Each tool call consumes tokens - Claude optimizes its calls"

**Transition to slide 13**:
"Now let's analyze what Claude found..."

**Energy**: Engaged - actively explain during execution
