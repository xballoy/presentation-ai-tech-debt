# Major migration: React 19.2

Migration prompt

```text
Plan the React migration from the frontend to the latest version (19.2).

Constraints:
- Do not migrate to TypeScript
- Ensure libraries compatibility with React 19.2
- Propose E2E testing strategy to validate before and after
```

<!--
**Timing**: 4-5 minutes

**Objective**: Show a complex migration with bidirectional interaction.

**LIVE DEMO (if time)**:
1. Show the prompt (displayed)
2. Launch Claude Code
3. **Show Ctrl+O** to see the thinking process
4. Wait for Claude to ask questions
5. Answer the questions
6. **Challenge the plan**: "Add a testing strategy with MSW"
7. Show the final generated plan

**NARRATION DURING THE DEMO**:

**If Claude thinking (Ctrl+O)**:
"Claude is thinking through the problem - analyzing dependencies, breaking changes..."

**When Claude asks questions**:
"See? It doesn't guess - it ASKS. This is assisted engineering, not vibe coding"

**When you challenge**:
"I'm not satisfied with the plan, I'm asking to add tests - Claude adapts"

**CONTINGENCY**:

**If > 40 min total**:
→ SKIP this slide, go directly to codemod (slide 17)

**If no Internet/error**:
→ "I had prepared a similar migration - here's the result..."
→ Show screenshots
- "Visible thinking process = debugging the AI's decisions"
- "Claude's questions = it identifies ambiguities"
- "You can iterate on the plan before executing"

**Transition to slide 17 (codemod)**:
"Let's now move to the most advanced automation: codemods..."

**Energy**: Collaborative - show human-AI interaction

**CHECKPOINT**:
"Third demo: Claude PLANS the migration, we CHALLENGE the plan"
