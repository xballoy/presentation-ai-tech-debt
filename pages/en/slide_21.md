# Key takeaways

## Five demos, one approach

1. **Code analysis**: AI analyzes, we evaluate
2. **Critical thinking**: AI estimated effort, we contextualize
3. **Migration decisions**: AI compared options, we chose
4. **Automation**: AI wrote code, we validated

<br />

## Where to start on your projects

- **Start small**: code analysis (low risk)
- **Develop critical thinking**: question everything
- **Expand progressively**: migration → refactoring → automation
- **Keep control**: AI proposes, you decide

<!--
**Timing**: 2 minutes

**Objective**: Synthesize learning and reinforce the main message.

**Talking points**:
- "You've seen 4 different demos, but the same pattern each time"
- "AI suggests, YOU validate - that's the difference with vibe coding"
- "Don't start by migrating React 19 - start by analyzing your code"
- "Build your confidence progressively"

**For advanced users**:
- "Codemods are powerful but require rigorous validation"
- "Think of AI as a very fast pair programmer that needs supervision"

**Transition to slide 19 (Resources)**:
"If you want to go deeper on these concepts..."

**Energy**: Authoritative - strong close with clear message

**Final checkpoint**: Reiterate one last time "AI suggests, human validates"
