# Objectives of this presentation

## What you'll see

- ✅ Practice **AI-assisted engineering** (not vibe coding)
- ✅ Understand and **validate each step**
- ✅ Apply on **real legacy code**

## Our test subject: extreme-carpaccio

A kata that illustrates a **common professional situation**:

- Inheriting a project that hasn't been maintained for several years.
- Despite its initial quality, the code now has significant technical debt.

**Positive point**: an existing test suite

<!--
**Timing**: 2 minutes

**Objective**: Set expectations and calibrate the audience.

**Talking points**:
- "You'll see 4 demos of increasing complexity"
- "Each time: AI proposes, YOU validate"
- "extreme-carpaccio = real code from 2015, full of technical debt"
- "Imagine inheriting this project tomorrow - how does AI help you?"

**POLL** (interactive):
- Count raised hands
- Adjust pace based on audience:
  - If majority "never used" → slow down on fundamentals
  - If majority "daily" → speed up, focus on critical validation
  - Mix → keep planned pace

**Response to poll**:
- If few hands for "daily": "Perfect, you'll see concrete use cases"
- If many "daily": "Excellent, this presentation will refine your approach with critical validation"
- "You'll probably recognize this pattern - Express 4.13, callbacks, no validation"
- "The techniques work on any legacy codebase"

**Transition to slide 9**:
"Here's the action plan for the next 30 minutes..."

**Energy**: Engaged - establish the contract with the audience
