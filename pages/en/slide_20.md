# And in real life?

Using AI to update and/or replace dependencies on projects

- Replace React-Script with Vite
- Migrate from React class components to function components
- Migrate React-Router 5x to 7x
- Replace moment with dayjs
- Major Material UI migration

<!-->

- Give the AI the migration documentation (or ask it to search for it)
- It doesn't work (yet) super well for UI libraries (no error feedback)
