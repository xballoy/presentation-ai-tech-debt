# The philosophy

Two approaches to using AI in development

::left::

## ❌ Vibe Coding

|                   |                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Prompts**       | "Create a user profile page" |
| **Validation**    | No review                    |
| **Understanding** | Blind copy-paste             |
| **Speed**         | ⚡ Fast at first             |
| **Long term**     | 💥 Technical debt            |

**Mindset**: "It works, that's good enough"

## ✅ AI-assisted engineering

|                   |                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Prompts**       | "Refactor UserService to use DI" |
| **Validation**    | Review + tests at each step      |
| **Understanding** | Understand and adapt             |
| **Speed**         | 🎯 Slower at first               |
| **Long term**     | 📈 Maintainable                  |

**Mindset**: "AI proposes, I validate"

<!--
**Timing**: 2 minutes

**KEY MESSAGE**: This is the thesis of the entire presentation. Emphasize this difference.

**Talking points**:
- "Vibe coding = 'It works, that's good enough' without really understanding (source: beyond.addy.ie)"
- "Vague vs precise prompts: 'Create a profile page' vs 'Refactor UserService to use DI'"
- "AI-assisted = validate at each step, keep control"
- "This presentation will show you how to do AI-assisted, not vibe coding"
- "Vibe coding gives you 70% quickly, but the remaining 30% creates debt"
- "Validation != blocking on every line, but understanding the strategy and verifying critical points"
- "AI excels at generating boilerplate, less at understanding your business context"

**Transition to slide 5**:
"To use these tools well, you need to understand how they work under the hood..."

**Checkpoint moment**: This slide reinforces the main message - come back to it throughout the presentation
