# The problem: technical debt accumulates

<v-clicks>

## How it happens

- External ecosystem degradation
- Accumulation of internal decisions
- Growth complexity

## AI can help... or make it worse

### ✅ Potential

- Analyze thousands of lines
- Detect obsolete patterns
- Propose migrations
- Automate refactoring

</div>

<div>

### ⚠️ Risk

- Out-of-context suggestions
- Unrealistic estimates
- Untested changes
- **Technical debt increases instead of decreasing**

<!--
**Timing**: 3 minutes

**Objective**: Concretely show how debt accumulates and why AI is a double-edged sword.

**Why technical debt accumulates**:

**External ecosystem degradation**
- Dependencies age and lose maintenance
- Security vulnerabilities accumulate in your stack
- Language idioms and best practices evolve beyond your code

**Accumulation of internal decisions**
- Early architectural choices become misaligned with current needs
- Shipping pressure creates shortcuts that enable more shortcuts
- Knowledge gaps let deviations from the original design multiply

**Growth complexity**
- Success brings edge cases and unforeseen feature interactions
- Systems built for small scale break under larger loads

**Talking points**:
- "Debt accumulates in three main ways"
- "First, the external ecosystem: your dependencies age, vulnerabilities accumulate, practices evolve"
- "Then internal decisions: architecture becomes obsolete, shortcuts lead to more shortcuts"
- "Finally, growth: success brings complexity, systems no longer scale"
- "To address this, AI promises to analyze thousands of lines and automate refactoring"
- "But beware: out-of-context suggestions, untested changes... AI can worsen the debt"
- "That's why this presentation shows how to use it rigorously"

**Transition to next slide**:
"To use AI well, let's start by defining some terms..."

**Engagement**:
- "Raise your hand if you've ever inherited a project with 5+ years of backlog"
- "How many have tried AI for this kind of problem?"

**Energy**: High - create identification with the problem
