# Compare alternatives before migrating

The agent analyzes options and recommends the best approach for your context.

## Example prompt

```text
Search body-parser alternatives.

Compare:
- Performance and bundle size
- API compatibility
- Migration effort
- Active maintenance

Recommend the best option for our use case.
```

**Timing**: 2-3 minutes

**Objective**: Show how to use AI for migration decisions.

**KEY MESSAGE**: Don't migrate blindly - analyze alternatives first.

**Talking points**:
- "body-parser is deprecated - but what should we migrate to?"
- "The agent can objectively compare multiple alternatives"
- "You get a detailed analysis: performance, compatibility, effort"
- "Then YOU decide based on your context"

**Transition to slide 17**:
"Sometimes, the best migration is removing the dependency..."

**Energy**: Pragmatic - focus on informed decisions
